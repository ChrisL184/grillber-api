# Grillber.me API Documentation


## Intro

The purpose of this documentation is to give fellow devs and users a good look of what's going on under the hood of Grillber!

Here's a quick rundown of what Grillber's API contains:
* `grillber.sql` has a CREATE TABLE statement that will lay the foundations for your database.
* `index.js` has all of our middleware, our express.js initialization, and starts our server!
* `grillber_api.js` consists of a set of methods that will retrieve/post/delete information from the database.
